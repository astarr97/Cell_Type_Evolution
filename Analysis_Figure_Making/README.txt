This contains jupyter notebooks used to make figures and do analysis after the parameter sweeps and DE calling.

ASD_SCZ.ipynb contains all the analysis and figure-making related to ASD and SCZ-linked genes (primarily Figure 6 and Supplemental Figures 35-38 and 41)

Checking_Negative_Selection.ipynb contains the code and analysis to check ASD-linked genes for changes in negative selection strength (Supplemental Figure 39).

Plotting_CellTypeProp_Vs_Divergence.ipynb contains all the code to ploy cell type proportion vs divergence.  This includes most of Figures 1-5 and Supplemental Figures 1-34 with exceptions noted below.

Plotting_MTG_DLG4.ipynb contains the code to plot DLG4 expression in the Allen_MTG pseudobulked data (related to Figure 6I).

PSD_Protein.ipynb contains the code to plot DLG4 protein abundance (related to Supplemental Figure 40).

Within_Human_Variation.ipynb contains the code to compute within human variation and compare to cell type proportion (related to Figure 5D).  Actual plotting of this was done in Plotting_CellTypeProp_Vs_Divergence.ipynb.
